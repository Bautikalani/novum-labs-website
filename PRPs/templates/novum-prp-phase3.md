```

### Animation Implementation Strategy

#### Task 1: Animation Library Setup
**File**: `[Main layout/app file]`
**Purpose**: Configure animation library with performance and accessibility in mind

```typescript
// Configuration approach:
// - Lazy load animation library
// - Configure reduced motion support
// - Set global animation defaults
// - Enable GPU acceleration
// - Configure gesture handling (if needed)

// Critical settings:
// - respectReducedMotion: true
// - Optimized bundle imports
// - Performance monitoring hooks
```

**Validation**:
- [ ] Library loads without blocking
- [ ] Reduced motion query detected
- [ ] Bundle size impact acceptable

#### Task 2: Core Animation Patterns
**Purpose**: Implement primary animation patterns from DESIGN.md

```typescript
// Common animation patterns:
// 1. Scroll-triggered reveals
//    - Fade in + translate
//    - Stagger children elements
//    - Once-only triggers
//    - Intersection Observer based

// 2. Micro-interactions
//    - Hover states (scale, brightness)
//    - Focus indicators
//    - Button feedback
//    - Form interactions

// 3. Page/Section transitions
//    - Smooth scrolling
//    - Section reveals
//    - Navigation transitions
```

**Performance Requirements**:
- Use CSS transforms only
- Avoid layout-triggering properties
- Implement will-change carefully
- Monitor paint/composite layers

#### Task 3: Scroll-Based Animations
**File**: `[Components using scroll animations]`
**Purpose**: Implement performant scroll-driven animations

```typescript
// Implementation approach:
// - Use Intersection Observer
// - Throttle/debounce scroll handlers
// - CSS-only where possible
// - Passive event listeners
// - Request Animation Frame for JS

// Common patterns:
// - Parallax effects (subtle only)
// - Progress indicators
// - Reveal animations
// - Sticky elements
```

#### Task 4: Interactive Component Enhancements
**Purpose**: Add micro-interactions to all interactive elements

For each interactive component:
```typescript
// Enhancement strategy:
// - Hover states (transform, opacity)
// - Active/pressed states
// - Focus animations
// - Loading states
// - Error state animations
// - Success feedback

// Timing guidelines from DESIGN.md:
// - Micro-interactions: 200-300ms
// - Page transitions: 400-600ms
// - Complex animations: 800-1200ms
```

#### Task 5: Reduced Motion Implementation
**File**: `[Global styles or animation utilities]`
**Purpose**: Ensure all animations respect user preferences

```css
/* Reduced motion strategy: */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  /* Option 1: Remove animations */
  * {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
  
  /* Option 2: Provide alternatives */
  .animated-element {
    /* Replace motion with opacity */
    /* Show final states immediately */
  }
}
```

**Testing approach**:
- Test with motion preference on/off
- Ensure content remains accessible
- Verify no broken layouts

#### Task 6: External Integrations
**Purpose**: Implement production features from INITIAL.md

Common integrations:
```typescript
// Analytics setup
// - Page view tracking
// - Event tracking
// - Performance monitoring

// External services
// - Booking/scheduling widgets
// - Chat systems
// - Email services
// - Payment processing

// Third-party content
// - Maps
// - Social media embeds
// - Video players
```

**Integration guidelines**:
- Lazy load when possible
- Handle loading states
- Provide fallbacks
- Monitor bundle impact

#### Task 7: Performance Optimization
**Purpose**: Ensure production performance

```typescript
// Optimization checklist:
// - Code splitting implementation
// - Lazy loading below fold
// - Image optimization
// - Font optimization
// - Critical CSS extraction
// - Service worker (if applicable)
// - CDN configuration
// - Compression setup
```

#### Task 8: Production Build Configuration
**Purpose**: Prepare for deployment

```typescript
// Build optimizations:
// - Minification settings
// - Tree shaking configuration  
// - Source map strategy
// - Environment variables
// - Error tracking setup
// - Performance budgets
```

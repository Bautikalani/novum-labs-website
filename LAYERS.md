# Development Layers

## Overview
Development happens across multiple concurrent layers. Each layer has:
- Clear ownership (which agents)
- Validation requirements
- Integration points
- Quality gates

## Layer Definitions

### üèóÔ∏è Foundation Layer
**Purpose**: Core structure and functionality
**Owners**: frontend-dev, backend-dev, tech-lead
**Key Elements**:
- HTML structure
- Component hierarchy  
- Routing & navigation
- Data fetching
- Core business logic

**Validation**:
- [ ] Semantic HTML
- [ ] Accessibility structure
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] SEO fundamentals
- [ ] Type safety

### üé® Design Layer
**Purpose**: Visual design and branding
**Owners**: ui-designer, frontend-dev
**Key Elements**:
- Color system (LCH)
- Typography scale
- Spacing system
- Component styling
- Dark/light themes

**Validation**:
- [ ] Design token usage
- [ ] Brand compliance
- [ ] Contrast ratios
- [ ] Visual consistency
- [ ] Responsive design

### ‚ú® Experience Layer
**Purpose**: Interactions and delight
**Owners**: frontend-dev, ui-designer, performance-engineer
**Key Elements**:
- Animations
- Transitions
- Micro-interactions
- Loading states
- Error handling UX

**Validation**:
- [ ] 60fps animations
- [ ] Reduced motion support
- [ ] Performance budgets
- [ ] Smooth interactions
- [ ] Accessibility maintained

### ‚úÖ Quality Layer
**Purpose**: Testing and standards
**Owners**: qa-engineer, tech-lead, all agents
**Key Elements**:
- Test coverage
- Performance metrics
- Accessibility audit
- Security review
- Documentation

**Validation**:
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Lighthouse 90+
- [ ] WCAG compliance
- [ ] Security scan clean
- [ ] Docs updated

## Layer Interaction Rules

1. **Changes cascade down, not up**
   - Foundation changes may affect all layers
   - Experience changes shouldn't break Foundation

2. **Validate affected layers only**
   - Don't run full validation for targeted changes
   - Smart detection of what needs checking

3. **Parallel development allowed**
   - Designer can work on Design while Dev implements Foundation
   - QA continuously monitors all layers

4. **Hotfix path available**
   - Critical fixes bypass normal flow
   - Post-fix validation ensures quality
